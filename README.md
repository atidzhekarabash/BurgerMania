# BurgerMania - Burger Restaurant Simulation in C#


A C# simulation of a small burger restaurant demonstrating design patterns. 
The system models a cashier, a head chef, and a kitchen with burgers and sauces.


## Design Patterns Used
- **Singleton**: Restaurant class – ensures only one restaurant instance exists.
- **Command**: Cashier and Head Chef – the cashier sends orders as commands to the chef.
- **Factory**: Kitchen and Burgers – creates different types of burgers.
- **Decorator**: Adding sauces to burgers – dynamically adds ketchup or garlic sauce to prepared
